## The Avasarala Class Super Yacht
[As seen at EosCon](https://coda.io/@arkhonus/eoscon-jul-2024-flyer/haywire-dynamics-42)

The Avasarala is my attempt at making a ship focused on luxury and being a status symbol.
I burnt out after a while so its yolol systems could use more work.

[The blueprint is free](#downloads). [In-game donations](#how-to-support--donate) are not required but greatly appreciated! Please support if you like the ship. ❤️

Since Starbase needs as many players enjoying it as possible, I don't like forcing payments so I take optional donations. My rule of thumb: try the ship out for free and then make a donation if you like it or use it in your designs!

## Change Log

### Mark 1
- Initial release

### Mark 2
- Removed side nacelles to reduce voxel usage
- Redesigned the rear with three plasma engines to reach the game's max speed allowed.
- Added interior seating and a stage for presentations and other social events.
- Improved yolol systems.

## Known Issues
- Ship roll is slow
- The hover system is not great, use at your own risk
- The fuel and propellant remaining calculators only function under load (so I added two versions)
