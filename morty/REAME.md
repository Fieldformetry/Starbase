Morty is an extremely simple and inexpensive long range scout ship/shuttle. Great for station hopping, long commutes, reconnaissance missions, or just sightseeing. [The blueprint is free](#download-blueprint). [All feedback is welcome](#providing-feedback). I don't have a lot of free time so support is limited.

## Providing Feedback

My in-game name is Haywire, feel free to send me an in-game email!

I would love to hear any suggestions you may have! Keep in mind however, that I may choose to not implement them due to lack of time or personal discretion.

## Derivatives 

Can I create and share modified versions of this ship?
Yes, you can on three conditions:

- You must give it away for free (like this one is)
- You must make some reference to this ship or me. For example: "Here is my ship, based on a Morty by Haywire"
- You must accept that those versions will be considered feedback and elements of them may be incorporated into future official releases without notification.
