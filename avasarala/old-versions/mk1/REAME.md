## The Avasarala Class Super Yacht (Old)

[As seen at EosCon](https://coda.io/d/EosCon-July-2022-Flyer_dKX9qJsmRR1/Haywire-Dynamics_suyru#Haywire-Dynamics-Ships_tue2h/r44&view=modal)

The Avasarala is my attempt at making a very form-over-function ship with intricate platework.
I burnt out after working on it for months so its yolol systems could use more work, which means it could be a great foundation for a ship design of your own as it is mainly hollow on its own.

[The blueprint is free](#downloads). I greatly appreciate [in-game donations](#how-to-support--donate) as support if you like the ship. ❤️

It took months of work but I don't feel right forcing payments for it when Starbase needs as many players enjoying it as possible so I take optional donations. My rule of thumb: try the ship out for free and then make a donation if you like it or use it in your designs!
